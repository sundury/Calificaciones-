## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
plot(
  cars, 
  xlab = "Velocidad", 
  ylab = "Distancia de frenado"
  )
```
